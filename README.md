Project: Customer Churn Prediction Using Random Forest with streamlit web interface

Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay with a service provider based on their profile and usage data. By implementing a machine learning model (Random Forest), the project aims to assist businesses in identifying potential churners and taking preventive measures to retain them.

Key Components:
Dataset:
Customer Data: The dataset typically contains customer demographic information, usage patterns, contract details, and billing information. Common features include:

Gender: Male or Female

SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen.

Partner: Whether the customer has a partner.

Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents.

Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the service.

PhoneService: Availability of phone service.

MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple phone lines.

Contract: Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two years).

TotalCharges: Total charges incurred by the customer.

Model: Random Forest
As Random Forest is a robust ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions for higher accuracy and reduced overfitting.
Suitable for both classification and regression tasks.
Handles missing data and works well with categorical and numerical data.

Model Training:
The model is trained on a labeled dataset where the target variable indicates churn (1 for churn, 0 for stay).
Preprocessing steps include:
Label encoding for categorical variables.
Standardization of numerical features (e.g., tenure and TotalCharges).

Web Interface:
The user interface (UI) was built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive and user-friendly web apps.

Features of the Web App:
Users can input customer details through dropdowns, text fields, and selection boxes.
On submission, the app processes the inputs, applies the trained model, and predicts whether the customer will churn or not.
The app also provides actionable insights, including:
Tips for Churn Prevention: For customers likely to churn, recommendations are provided to improve retention.
Tips for Retention: For customers likely to stay, suggestions are offered to maintain their loyalty.

Workflow:
Data Input:
Users provide customer details (e.g., gender, tenure, contract type, etc.) through the web interface.
Data Preprocessing:
Input data is preprocessed (e.g., encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features) to match the model's training setup.
Prediction:
The preprocessed data is fed into the trained Random Forest model.
The model outputs a prediction: Churn (1) or Not Churn (0).
Output Display:
The app displays whether the customer is likely to churn or stay.
Relevant tips and suggestions are displayed based on the prediction.
